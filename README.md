# Using the Ferrite library of the Julia programming language to implement finite element methods

Creation of mathematical algorithms and program codes for performing engineering calculations
using the FEA-library Ferrite.jl.
Within the framework of the project, four software codes were created for solving problems of linear elasticity, hyperelasticity, calculating the von Mises plasticity criterion, heat transfer problems and transient nonlinear problems. To perform these calculations, the open source Ferrite.jl library of the Julia programming language was used.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the computational capabilities of the Julia language in the field of numerical methods for solving real-life engineering problems.
